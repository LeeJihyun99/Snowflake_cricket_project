# Cricket Matches Data Pipeline and Dashboard
## Overview
This project implements a data pipeline to process semi-structured JSON files containing cricket match data. The pipeline is designed using Snowflake, with automated data ingestion, transformation, and visualization via a customized dashboard. This project was initially developed by following a video tutorial. I then customized and extended the project, particularly in the dashboard and automation sections.


## Getting Started
#### Snowflake Setup (Free Trial)
If you're new to Snowflake, you can start with a free trial account. Here's a quick setup guide:

#### Create a Snowflake Account:
Go to Snowflake [Sign Up](https://signup.snowflake.com/) and register for a free trial.
After signing up, you'll receive a Username and a Dedicated Login URL.
```
Username: <yourusername>
Login URL: https://<youraccountname>.snowflakecomputing.com
```

### Install SnowSQL (Command-Line Interface):
Download and install SnowSQL from the [Snowflake Downloads](https://www.snowflake.com/en/developers/downloads/snowsql/).
Connect to Snowflake using the following command:
```
snowsql -a <youraccountname> -u <yourusername>
```
Enter your password when prompted.

### Verify Connection:
If the connection is successful, you will see a Snowflake prompt where you can run SQL commands.
To exit, type:
``` Ctrl+D ```
## Technologies Used
#### Snowflake: For data storage, transformation, and flattening nested JSON data.
#### JSON: Semi-structured data format containing cricket match details.
#### Dashboarding Tool: Snowflake's native interface.
#### Automation: Snowflake tasks and streams for handling new data insertions in real-time.
#### [JSON Viewer](https://jsonviewer.tools/editor): to visualize JSON file structure.
#### [DBeaver](https://sosbornlaw.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA9bq6BhAKEiwAH6bqoOHbmOl3YezBtBSD7unzmfsE4lcTAyAdUaYvFp3eo0p7BBC1HAC5yRoCPqAQAvD_BwE): To generate diagrams for fact, dimensional tables.

## Architecture
Below is the overall architecture of the project:
![image]
#### The pipeline consists of the following layers:
- Landing Layer: Initial data ingestion and staging.
- Raw Layer: Loading raw data into Snowflake tables.
- Clean Layer: Flattening and curating data.
- Consumption Layer: Creating fact and dimension tables for analytics

## Landing Layer
This section explains how to set up and manage the Landing Layer in Snowflake, including database creation, file format, staging, and loading JSON files into Snowflake tables.
1. Set Role, Warehouse, and Create Database and Schemas
In the Snowflake Web UI:
- Set the Role and Warehouse to execute queries with proper permissions:
```
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
USE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH;
```
- Create a Database and Schema:
```
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS CRICKET;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS CRICKET.LAND;
```

2. Create File Format
A File Format in Snowflake defines how to interpret the structure of a file during data import/export.

- JSON File Format for this project:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT cricket.land.my_json_format
    TYPE = JSON
    NULL_IF = ('\\n', 'null', '')  -- Values to interpret as NULL
    STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY = TRUE       -- (Optional) Remove outer array brackets (Not needed for this project since files don't have outer brackets.)
    COMMENT = 'JSON File Format with outer strip array flag true';
```

3. Create Internal Stage
A Stage is a temporary storage location for files before loading them into Snowflake tables.

- Internal Stage Creation:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE cricket.land.my_stg;
```

#### Types of Stages:
- Internal Stage:

Managed by Snowflakeâ€™s internal storage. No external cloud storage account is required.

Example: JSON file 1384401.json uploaded to the my_stg stage is stored within Snowflake.

- External Stage:
  
Data is stored outside Snowflake (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage) and read directly from the external storage.

#### Why Stages Are Essential:
- Improves Performance: Enables parallel data loading.
- Flexibility: Reuse, inspect, and validate files before loading.
- Supports External Data: Access data from external storage systems.
- Decoupled Architecture: Separate compute and storage operations for efficient data handling.

#### You can also load JSON files using CLI.

Connect to SnowSQL:
```
snowsql -a <youraccountname> -u <your username>
```

Set Database, Schema, Warehouse, and Role:
```
USE DATABASE CRICKET;
USE SCHEMA LAND;
USE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH;
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
```

Upload JSON Files to the Stage:
```
PUT <your local path to the folder with your json files>/*.json @my_stg/cricket/json/;
```

## Raw Layer
The Raw Layer is where the original JSON data is ingested and stored as-is. This layer does not perform any transformations; it simply stores the raw data, often in nested formats (like arrays, objects, etc.). The Raw Layer is crucial because it serves as the foundation for all subsequent transformations, ensuring that the original data is preserved and can be revisited or corrected as necessary.

Before you proceed with creating raw tables and ingesting data, create a schema named raw in your Snowflake database.
```
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS raw;
```
### Create Raw Table
Create the Raw Table that will store the JSON data from the files you upload. This table includes columns to store the various fields (e.g., meta, info, innings) and metadata like the file name, row number, and hash key for auditing.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE raw.match_raw_tbl (
    meta OBJECT NOT NULL,
    info VARIANT NOT NULL,
    innings ARRAY NOT NULL,
    stg_file_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    stg_file_row_number INT NOT NULL,
    stg_file_hashkey TEXT NOT NULL,
    stg_modified_ts TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```
### Load Data into Raw Table
You can now load the raw JSON files into the raw.match_raw_tbl table. The COPY INTO command will load the data while preserving the structure.
```
COPY INTO raw.match_raw_tbl
FROM (
    SELECT
        t.$1:meta::OBJECT AS meta,
        t.$1:info::VARIANT AS info,
        t.$1:innings::ARRAY AS innings,
        metadata$filename AS stg_file_name,
        metadata$file_row_number AS stg_file_row_number,
        metadata$file_content_key AS stg_file_hashkey,
        metadata$file_last_modified AS stg_modified_ts
    FROM @cricket.land.my_stg/cricket/json (FILE_FORMAT => 'cricket.land.my_json_format') t
)
ON_ERROR = CONTINUE;
```
The ON_ERROR = CONTINUE option ensures that the load process continues even if some rows fail, allowing valid rows to be loaded while problematic rows are skipped.
Inspect failed rows in SnowSight for debugging and re-upload fixed files.

## Clean Layer
The Clean Layer is where nested data is transformed into a more structured format. This process involves flattening the data (e.g., arrays and objects) to make it easier for analysis.

### Create Player Info Table
Flatten the nested data in the info:players field to extract player information for each match.
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE cricket.clean.player_clean_tbl AS (
    SELECT 
        raw.info:match_type_number::INT AS match_type_number,
        p.key::TEXT AS country,
        team.value::TEXT AS player_name,
        raw.stg_file_name,
        raw.stg_file_row_number,
        raw.stg_file_hashkey,
        raw.stg_modified_ts
    FROM raw.match_raw_tbl raw,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => raw.info:players) p,
    LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => p.value) team
);
```

#### Why Use LATERAL?
Flatten works on a single row, while LATERAL is used to apply the flattening to each row in the dataset.

### Enforce NOT NULL Constraints
Ensure critical columns do not contain null values for fields that are essential to the analysis.
```
ALTER TABLE cricket.clean.player_clean_tbl
MODIFY COLUMN match_type_number SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE cricket.clean.player_clean_tbl
MODIFY COLUMN country SET NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE cricket.clean.player_clean_tbl
MODIFY COLUMN player_name SET NOT NULL;
```
### Create Match Info Table
```
create or replace transient table cricket.clean.match_detail_clean as(
select 
info:match_type_number::int as match_type_number,
info:event.name::text as event_name,
case
when info:match_number::text is not null then info:match_number
when info:match_stage::text is not null then info:match_stage
else 'NA' end as match_stage,
info:dates[0]::date as event_date,
date_part('year', info:dates[0]::date) as event_year,
date_part('month', info:dates[0]::date) as event_month,
date_part('day', info:dates[0]::date) as event_day,
info:match_type::text as match_type,
info:season::text as season,
info:team_type::text as team_type,
info:overs::text as overs,
info:city::text as city,
info:venue::text as venue,
info:gender::text as gender,
info:teams[0]::text as first_team,
info:teams[1]::text as second_team,
case
when info:outcome.winner is not null then 'Result Declared'
when info:outcome.result = 'tie' then 'Tie'
when info:outcome.reult = 'no result' then 'No Result'
else info:outcome.result end as match_result,
case 
when info:outcome.winner is not null then info:outcome.winner else 'NA' end as winner,
info:toss.winner::text as toss_winner,
initcap(info:toss.decision::text) as toss_decision,
-- 
stg_file_name,
stg_file_row_number,
stg_file_hashkey,
stg_modified_ts
from cricket.raw.match_raw_tbl
);
```
### Create Delivery Info Table
Flatten the complex nested JSON data to extract detailed delivery-level information for the match.
```
CREATE OR REPLACE TRANSIENT TABLE cricket.clean.delivery_clean_tbl AS
SELECT 
    tbl.info:match_type_number::INT AS match_type_number,
    i.value:team::TEXT AS team_name,
    o.value:over::INT + 1 AS over,
    d.value:bowler::TEXT AS bowler,
    d.value:batter::TEXT AS batter,
    d.value:non_striker::TEXT AS non_striker,
    d.value:runs.batter::TEXT AS runs,
    d.value:runs.extras::TEXT AS extras,
    d.value:runs.total::TEXT AS total,
    e.key::TEXT AS extra_type,
    e.value::INT AS extra_runs,
    w.value:player_out::TEXT AS player_out,
    w.value:kind::TEXT AS player_out_kind,
    w.value:fielders::VARIANT AS player_out_fielders,
    f.value:name::TEXT AS fielder_name,
    f.value:substitute::TEXT AS substitute,
    tbl.stg_file_name,
    tbl.stg_file_row_number,
    tbl.stg_file_hashkey,
    tbl.stg_modified_ts
FROM raw.match_raw_tbl tbl,
LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => tbl.innings) i,
LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => i.value:overs) o,
LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => o.value:deliveries) d,
LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => d.value:extras, OUTER => TRUE) e,
LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => d.value:wickets, OUTER => TRUE) w,
LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => w.value:fielders, OUTER => TRUE) f;
```

## Consumption Layer
The Consumption Layer is where the cleaned data are structured into fact and dimension tables. These tables are crucial for analytical purposes, enabling efficient querying and reporting.

Fact and dimension tables are designed and architected based on the data and structure provided in the video tutorial. These tables are then used for further analysis and reporting.
You can refer to the diagram to better understand the relationships between the tables.
